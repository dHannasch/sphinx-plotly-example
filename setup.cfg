# can be run by any user with pytest --pyargs sphinx_plotly_example.
# Packages that are sensitive to the host machine, most famously NumPy,
# include tests with the installed package so that any user can check
# at any time that everything is working properly.
# If you do choose to make installable tests, this will run the installed
# tests as they are actually installed (same principle as when we ensure that
# we always test the installed version of the package).
# If you have no need for this (and your src/ directory is very large),
# you can save a few milliseconds on testing by telling pytest not to search
# the src/ directory by removing
# --pyargs and sphinx_plotly_example from the options here.
